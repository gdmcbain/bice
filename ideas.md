# Ideas
- Add newton solver class and use it
- use better newton solver in arclength continuation
- Add default interfaces for FEM, FD and pseudospectral discretizations
- implement default norm (L2-norm?)
- implement: a problem should consist of one or multiple "Equations" and is then assembled. --> generalize this assembly process.
- implement constraints as equations
- implement automatic recording of branches in the Problem class
- Eigensolver
- bifurcation detection
- branch switching
- mesh adaption
